# Generic variables
# #########################################################
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Internal port AND external port! UPDATE\CHECK THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE COMPOSE FILE
PORT=3300

# We use fixed IP address, but this is not strict required. In case of problems you can remove it from the compose file completely
FIXED_SUBNET=172.25.0.0/16      # Same as 'base service'
FIXED_IP=172.25.0.20            # Different as 'base service' (172.16.10.19)


# For Docker running Window Containers, not sure about Docker Linux
# THIS DOES NOT WORK in COMPOSE FILE:
#
#     env_file:                               # THIS horrible feature, does not work with sub directories or/and alternative names
#      - ./cra.env                            # Forget about it, it just DON'T work!
#
#	For this reason all variables are mixed-up in one .env file (said but true)
